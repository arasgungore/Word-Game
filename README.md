Welcome to the Word Game!


### Rules

- You will try to guess a total of 14 words/phrases according to the definitions given in 4 minutes.
The words/phrases will be presented to you one by one, and they will have 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 letters for each pair respectively.

- You will earn 100 points per letter from the words/phrases you guess correctly from these 14 words/phrases.
(a total of 98 letters, which makes the highest possible score 9800)

- For help, you can reveal a letter of current the word/phrase by pressing the 'H' key; but you cannot get points from the revealed letters.
You can stop the timer by pressing the 'B' key (Benjamin), but you cannot reveal letters after stopping the timer anymore.

- You will have 30 seconds to guess the current word/phrase after the timer stops. If you cannot guess the word/phrase correctly within this time,
you will be penalized 100 points per unrevealed letter of the word/phrase.

- You can press the 'P' key to pause, and the 'Escape' key to exit the game at any given time.

Press any key to start the game.
